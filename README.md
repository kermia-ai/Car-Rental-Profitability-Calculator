# Car-Rental-Profitability-Calculator
This Python script uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a car rental profitability calculator. 
The user can input the annual gross revenue (in euros), the rental expenses (in euros), and the car's price (in euros). By clicking the "Calculate" button, 
the script will compute the profitability percentage and display the result in the GUI.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
tkinter

Installation:
Install Python 3.x from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
tkinter is included with Python. No additional installation is required.

Usage:
Save the script as car_rental_profitability_calculator.py.
Run the script using the following command: python car_rental_profitability_calculator.py.
A GUI window will appear. Enter the required values and click "Calculate" to compute the profitability percentage.
Functionality
calculer_rentabilite: This function calculates the profitability of a rental car using the formula ((annual_gross_revenue - rental_expenses) / car_price) * 100. The result is then displayed in the GUI window.
Troubleshooting
If the script does not run or displays an error, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and that the tkinter library is available.
If the script does not display the result, ensure that you have entered valid numeric values for annual gross revenue, rental expenses, and car price.
